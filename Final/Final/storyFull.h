But... like most stories of Heroism, \nthis peace was inevitably disrupted. \n\nOne day Monsters began to appear and started terrorizing the Kingdom. The \nguard, through their centuries of peace, grew lazy and weak proving that \nthey were no match for these malevolent beasts. Many-a-folk died in the \nfollowing years. \n\nThe King, reluctantly, was forced to shut the gates of Makuria in order \nto find a solution to their problem. The entire city was cut off from the \noutside world. The vast fortune that was collected over the years was used \nto repair the continuous damage to their walls, nearly emptying their \ncoffers. The city was on high alert with many of the citizens barricading \nthemselves in their homes, hoping that they'd have enough rations to \nsurvive the week, and the vast amount of dormant criminals took advantage \nof this mass hysteria to perform their vicious acts. \n\nWith no salvation in sight, these were truly dark times...\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           One Year Later \n                        Where our story begins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"};

At one point one of the \narmoured man yells after the man... \n\nGuard #1: \"You can't run forever Felix! We'll catch you eventually!!\" \nFelix Smirks \nFelix: \"You've been saying that for months, Anthony; when are you gonna \ndeliver?\n \n\nAs soon as Felix finished his quip, he reached a cross section in the \nalleyway, and without skipping a beat, he turned right and, almost \nmechanically, he reached towards the nearby stack of crates and knocked \nthem over, blocking the alleyway. A few moments after the clanging of the \nguards armour stops at the crates, Felix smiles, turns, and begins to \ntrot down the muddy alleyway, leaving the cursing guards behind. \n\nA few moments later, Felix exits the alleyways onto the cobblestone main \nroad. The sun has just about to rise, casting a golden light onto the \ngray housing of the kingdom, almost creating a facade that the city was \nin its golden age of wealth and jubilation. \n\nFelix paid no mind to the empty streets that used to be cluttered with \nmerchants and people; in less than a minute, Felix walked towards a small \nwooden and stone shack that was dwarfed by the surrounding buildings. \nWith the brown bag clutched between his arms, Felix walks towards the \nbuildings door and knocks. After a brief moment of silence the door opens, \nbut only slightly, to reveal a skinny, short, gray haired, old man \npeering out into the streets. \n\nAs soon as the man saw Felix, though, his eyes widened and he swung the \ndoor all the way open to usher Felix inside. As soon as Felix was inside \nthe old shack the man closed and locked the door, and as soon as he turned \naround Felix thrusted the bag into the man's arms. Felix retreated to the \nold wooden table, that was in the far left corner of the one room building, \nwhere he plopped down into one of the many old looking chairs surrounding \nit, where the man began to speak in a frantic raspy voice. \n\nOld Man Jenkins: \"OH!.. Uhh.. T-Thank you Felix..\" \nAt which point the man opens the sack to reveal an assortment of stale \nbread and old cheeses. \nFelix: \"Yea.. Don't mention it, Herold..\" \nFelix Leaned back in his chair, exhausted, and closed his eyes, leaving \nthe room and the man, who was staring at the brown bag, in silent. After a \nbrief pause, the man spoke, not looking away from the bag, in an almost \ntimid fashion. \n\nOld Man Jenkins: \"So.. Uhh... where did you get them this time?..\" \nFelix smirks with his eyes still closed \nFelix: \"Heh.. Just a few greedy nobles on the other side of town who think \nthey can hoard food while others starve.\"" };

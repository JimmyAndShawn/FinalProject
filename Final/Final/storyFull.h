But... like most stories of Heroism, \nthis peace was inevitably disrupted. \n\nOne day Monsters began to appear and started terrorizing the Kingdom. The \nguard, through their centuries of peace, grew lazy and weak proving that \nthey were no match for these malevolent beasts. Many-a-folk died in the \nfollowing years. \n\nThe King, reluctantly, was forced to shut the gates of Makuria in order \nto find a solution to their problem. The entire city was cut off from the \noutside world. The vast fortune that was collected over the years was used \nto repair the continuous damage to their walls, nearly emptying their \ncoffers. The city was on high alert with many of the citizens barricading \nthemselves in their homes, hoping that they'd have enough rations to \nsurvive the week, and the vast amount of dormant criminals took advantage \nof this mass hysteria to perform their vicious acts. \n\nWith no salvation in sight, these were truly dark times...\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           One Year Later \n                        Where our story begins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"};
